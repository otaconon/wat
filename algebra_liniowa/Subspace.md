>[!definition] Subspace
>A subset $U$ of $V$ is called a _subspace_ of $V$ if $U$ is also a vector space with the same additive identity, and scalar multiplication as on $V$

>[!definition] Direct sum, $\oplus$
>- Suppose $V_{1}, \dots, V_{m}$ is called a _direct sum_ if each element of $V_{1} + \dots V_{m}$ can be written in only one way as a sum $v_{1} + \dots + v_{m}$, where each $v_{k} \in V_{k}$ 
>- If $V_{1} + \dots + V_{m}$ is a direct sum, then $V_{1} \oplus \dots \oplus V_{m}$ denotes $V_{1} + \dots + V_{m}$ with the $\oplus$ notation serving as an indication that this is a direct sum
