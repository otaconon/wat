>[!definition] Span
>The set of all linear combinations of a list of vectors $v_{1}, \dots, v_{m}$ in $V$ is called the _span_ of $v_{1},\dots,v_{m}$ denoted by $\text{span}(v_{1},\dots,v_{m})$. In other words,
>$$
\text{span}(v_{1},\dots,v_{m}) = \left\{ a_{1}v_{1} + \dots a_{m} v_{m}: a_{1},\dots, a_{m} \in F \right\}
>$$
>The span of the empty list is defined to be ${0}$

>[!definition] Spans
>If $\text{span}(v_{1},\dots,v_{m})$ equals $V$, we say that the list $v_{1},\dots,v_{m}$ _spans_ $V$

>[!definition] finite-dimensional vector space
>A vector space is called _finite-dimensional_ if some list of vectors in it spans the space

>[!theorem] span is the smallest containing subspace
>The span of a list of vectors in $V$ is the smallest subspace of $V$ containing all vectors in the list
