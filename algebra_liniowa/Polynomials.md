>[!definition] polynomial, $\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$
>- A function $p: \mathbf{F} \to F$ is called a polynomial with coefficients in $\mathbf{F}$ if there exist $a_{0},\dots,a_{m} \in \mathbf{F}$ such that
>$$
>p(z) = a_{0} + a_{1}z + a_{2}z^2 + \dots + a_{m} z^m
>$$
>for all $z \in \mathbf{F}$
>- $\mathcal{P}(F)$ is the set of all polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbf{F}$

>[!definition] degree of a polynomial $\text{deg } p$
>- A polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{F})$ is said to have _degree $m$_ if there exists scalars $a_{0}, a_{1}, \dots, a_{m} \in \mathbf{F}$ with $a_{m} \neq 0$ such that for every $z \in \mathbf{F}$, we have
>$$
>p(z) = a_{0} + a_{1}z + \dots + a_{m}z^m

>- The polynomial that is identity $0$ is said to have degree
>- The degree of a polynomial $p$ is denoted by $\text{deg } p$

>[!definition] $\mathcal{P}_{m}(\mathbf{F})$
>For $m$ a nonnegative integer, $\mathcal{P}_{m}(\mathbf{F})$ denotes the set of all polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbf{F}$ and degree at most $m$
